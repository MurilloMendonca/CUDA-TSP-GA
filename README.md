# Traveling Sales Man
## Genetic Algorithm with CUDA

In the actuall code configuration. It loads a distance matrix for asymmetric Traveling Sales Man. The matrix can be found at the mat.dat file as a binary generated by the following code:

```cpp
void CriaMatrizRandom(int t)
{
float *v =  new float[t*t];
int r=0;
for(int i=0;i<t*t;i++)
{
    if(i%t ==r)
    {
        v[i] =0;
        r++;
        if(i+1<t*t)
        {
            v[i+1] = 1;
            i++;
        }
    }
    else
        v[i] = num_aleatorio(1,1000);
}
```

This code ensure that the main diagonal of the matrix is formed by '0' and there is by its sitde a diagonal formed by '1'.  This condition was adopted for a better artifical case, just to be sure that the GA will find the best way.

To run the code you must compile the file main.cu :

```
nvcc -o [nomeDesejadoDoExecutavel] main.cu
```
